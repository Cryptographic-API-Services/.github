# Cryptographic API Services

## About
We are Cryptographic API Services, a team dedicated to providing secure and reliable cryptographic solutions through our APIs. Our services are designed to help developers integrate advanced cryptographic functionalities into their applications with ease and confidence.

We do not directly write the cryptographic algorithms ourselves, but rather we leverage well-established libraries and frameworks to ensure the highest standards of security and performance. The organizations we utilize are RustCrypto and Dalek Cryptography. We produce higher level languagae SDKs that interface with these Rust libraries in various languages.
